[00:00.000 --> 00:18.000]  So it's in the complement that is where it gets interesting.
[00:18.000 --> 00:22.000]  By the way, non-drawal traffic basically means your private addresses.
[00:22.000 --> 00:31.000]  So you expect that, you know, those kinds of packets do not, you will not observe that again before.
[00:31.000 --> 00:35.000]  So the time of the role in networking is that things that you don't ever expect to happen
[00:35.000 --> 00:39.000]  will happen roughly by 5% of the class.
[00:39.000 --> 00:42.000]  The whole screw for any protocol is a solution.
[00:42.000 --> 00:45.000]  50% is customer specific filters.
[00:45.000 --> 00:54.000]  A really cool person who do not filter, they don't care, despite actually screw-crafting creating a lot of issues.
[00:54.000 --> 01:00.000]  So I think traffic originating within the network, 65% filter before reaches a risk.
[01:00.000 --> 01:06.000]  This is not because it's, you know, the relevant action or anything.
[01:06.000 --> 01:13.000]  If you do this, it's basically trying to say they're trying to stay resources in their own network.
[01:13.000 --> 01:19.000]  So basically you're trying to reduce the utilization of packets,
[01:19.000 --> 01:22.000]  and it is being used to having a topic that you shouldn't be kept.
[01:22.000 --> 01:25.000]  So it's in the best interest of the network to do this.
[01:25.000 --> 01:31.000]  Again, incentive for all of these things is to improve their bottom line that will do it if it doesn't do it.
[01:31.000 --> 01:39.000]  The key thing is that many filters are static and non-powered with prefixes because, you know,
[01:39.000 --> 01:44.000]  if you're trying to do anything more intelligent, the problem is that how do you maintain your prefixes?
[01:44.000 --> 01:45.000]  This is a hard problem.
[01:45.000 --> 01:50.000]  And approximately half the plug here is specific filters, depending on who your peers are.
[01:50.000 --> 01:54.000]  Again, based on business managers.
[01:54.000 --> 01:59.000]  Yes, so these filters are applied on the destination IP address.
[01:59.000 --> 02:02.000]  No, both on the destination and the source.
[02:02.000 --> 02:03.000]  What is it?
[02:03.000 --> 02:06.000]  You're talking about egress traffic from your own network and dropping.
[02:06.000 --> 02:08.000]  That could be based on both.
[02:08.000 --> 02:09.000]  Yeah.
[02:09.000 --> 02:10.000]  Yeah.
[02:10.000 --> 02:11.000]  Why not?
[02:11.000 --> 02:13.000]  Oh, they're fear of dropping glitches in traffic.
[02:13.000 --> 02:17.000]  And this is the number one concern.
[02:17.000 --> 02:20.000]  Nobody cares about you living traffic that is illegitimate,
[02:20.000 --> 02:26.000]  but people would complain if you drop glitches around.
[02:27.000 --> 02:32.000]  The same thing as your member of the browser is actually complaining about back sets.
[02:32.000 --> 02:37.000]  As long as there's no, you know, you know, the incentives are aligned,
[02:37.000 --> 02:40.000]  and the mechanisms are designed in such that you can always point to English
[02:40.000 --> 02:43.000]  and exactly who's causing the issue.
[02:43.000 --> 02:45.000]  Then everything is good.
[02:45.000 --> 02:50.000]  Modulo that, you know, the incentive is easier.
[02:50.000 --> 02:55.000]  But also maintaining up-to-date lists are pretty high.
[02:55.000 --> 02:59.000]  Today, you might think that, look, I'm not supposed to source this traffic
[02:59.000 --> 03:05.000]  because of my network, or any of my customer networks do not announce this prefix,
[03:05.000 --> 03:06.000]  so I should drop it.
[03:06.000 --> 03:10.000]  But that business leadership could change your own app, and it does happen.
[03:10.000 --> 03:14.000]  And so once again, you know, if you do have your routers actually
[03:14.000 --> 03:17.000]  configured to drop certain traffic, you know,
[03:17.000 --> 03:20.000]  changing that becomes really high, updating that.
[03:20.000 --> 03:23.000]  By the way, network administrators are as much as possible
[03:23.000 --> 03:26.000]  to do that when I touch router configurations, right?
[03:26.000 --> 03:30.000]  Because most of the time, the output is that you see issues
[03:30.000 --> 03:33.000]  that you can't do this because of those configurations.
[03:33.000 --> 03:38.000]  So nobody wants to touch a router, especially a core router, right?
[03:38.000 --> 03:43.000]  If it's running fine, no one's complaining you want to keep it back.
[03:43.000 --> 03:46.000]  No incentives.
[03:47.000 --> 03:49.000]  All right.
[03:49.000 --> 03:51.000]  Let's reduce some more.
[03:56.000 --> 03:58.000]  So there's a paper that I was talking about,
[03:58.000 --> 04:01.000]  which is talking about how prevalent is a school thing,
[04:01.000 --> 04:04.000]  and it's a passive approach.
[04:04.000 --> 04:06.000]  So this is something that you also see.
[04:06.000 --> 04:09.000]  The particular user is now just about, you know, writing code
[04:09.000 --> 04:13.000]  and trying to bring down a server or trying to design equations.
[04:13.000 --> 04:16.000]  Sometimes it involves active or passive approach.
[04:16.000 --> 04:19.000]  You're basically trying to collect data from a vantage point.
[04:19.000 --> 04:21.000]  Could be a router.
[04:21.000 --> 04:23.000]  Could be a firewall.
[04:23.000 --> 04:27.000]  Could be an IXP, like the AM6.
[04:27.000 --> 04:29.000]  And then you get data from them, you analyze,
[04:29.000 --> 04:32.000]  trying to get insights into what's happening.
[04:35.000 --> 04:37.000]  So ability to schools.
[04:37.000 --> 04:40.000]  In 2017, there was a landmark study which actually showed
[04:40.000 --> 04:43.000]  that school thing is possible in more than 34 percent,
[04:43.000 --> 04:47.000]  roughly about 2500 percent deficit.
[04:47.000 --> 04:50.000]  Actually possible in 2017.
[04:50.000 --> 04:52.000]  This was an active measurement.
[04:52.000 --> 04:57.000]  As I said, you send a probe claiming that you are from a particular address
[04:57.000 --> 04:59.000]  that, you know, it's schooled,
[04:59.000 --> 05:02.000]  and checking whether it was actually being detected in the graph.
[05:02.000 --> 05:07.000]  This was done by some good friends of mine in the US.
[05:07.000 --> 05:10.000]  This is still the last, I think, study that was done
[05:10.000 --> 05:13.000]  using active measurements for detecting spoofing.
[05:13.000 --> 05:15.000]  I don't think there will be any more studies,
[05:15.000 --> 05:17.000]  especially for detecting spoofing.
[05:17.000 --> 05:20.000]  This was itself very hard.
[05:20.000 --> 05:23.000]  Active measurements, especially of certain kinds,
[05:23.000 --> 05:25.000]  are highly discouraged because network algorithms
[05:25.000 --> 05:27.000]  really don't like it.
[05:27.000 --> 05:30.000]  Do not even think measurements are actually considered useless.
[05:30.000 --> 05:34.000]  A few days ago, there was even an RFC saying, you know,
[05:34.000 --> 05:36.000]  how you're supposed to do network measurements.
[05:36.000 --> 05:40.000]  When you send a probe, how you're supposed to immediately get to the whole world,
[05:40.000 --> 05:44.000]  what, you know, what's the intent of that particular probe?
[05:44.000 --> 05:47.000]  And like I told you in the last class, sometimes it's backfires, right?
[05:47.000 --> 05:51.000]  So if you do all the things and then say, look, you know, here is live, you know,
[05:51.000 --> 05:54.000]  I'm probing and I'm academic and all I'm trying to do is checking,
[05:54.000 --> 05:57.000]  what do you know on benefit, whether the protocols you've deployed
[05:57.000 --> 05:59.000]  or your network is configured, right?
[05:59.000 --> 06:02.000]  It will still come after you and then say, all sorts of things.
[06:03.000 --> 06:07.000]  Anyway, this paper is actually not about the ability to just move
[06:07.000 --> 06:10.000]  and simply checking the prevalence of spoofing.
[06:10.000 --> 06:14.000]  And these kinds of studies are easier to do because you're not trying to send probes
[06:14.000 --> 06:17.000]  or simply saying, I have traffic, sample traffic, usually,
[06:17.000 --> 06:21.000]  and you're trying to analyze a traffic to go out and insights.
[06:21.000 --> 06:25.000]  It is an A as a valid source for a given IP address, right?
[06:25.000 --> 06:28.000]  So if you could answer this question for any arbitrary extent
[06:28.000 --> 06:30.000]  or any IP address,
[06:31.000 --> 06:34.000]  you could actually launch a very successful stuff, even though
[06:34.000 --> 06:36.000]  that this is really harsh.
[06:38.000 --> 06:40.000]  For a scalp, it's easy, yes?
[06:40.000 --> 06:42.000]  Yeah, I'll push this slide.
[06:42.000 --> 06:44.000]  It looks like partially spoofing.
[06:44.000 --> 06:45.000]  What was that about?
[06:47.000 --> 06:50.000]  I don't know if exactly the fact that spoofing could mean that
[06:50.000 --> 06:53.000]  for some cases it might, for some specific prefixes it would be.
[06:53.000 --> 06:55.000]  That's what I would guess.
[06:55.000 --> 06:58.000]  So the info for the previous...
[06:59.000 --> 07:03.000]  Oh, sorry, info from the previous slide, the 34% and something else.
[07:04.000 --> 07:09.000]  That paper is not about the ability to spoofing with the prevalence.
[07:09.000 --> 07:13.000]  No, this one is actually, I haven't even mentioned this thing because I'm going to...
[07:13.000 --> 07:14.000]  Yeah.
[07:14.000 --> 07:15.000]  So this is a different paper.
[07:15.000 --> 07:18.000]  This was a study in an August study.
[07:18.000 --> 07:23.000]  This was from a couple of institutes in the US and the West Coast.
[07:23.000 --> 07:27.000]  The US-enabled lab degree stands for it, and probably Berkeley.
[07:27.000 --> 07:31.000]  And what they did was they actually wrote a...
[07:31.000 --> 07:33.000]  It's a tool that is still widely used.
[07:33.000 --> 07:35.000]  It's called scamper.
[07:35.000 --> 07:39.000]  It's a trace out tool that could also be used to send some probes and all that.
[07:39.000 --> 07:44.000]  So they did a study, which is about a hundred, to basically check.
[07:44.000 --> 07:50.000]  Suppose I actually send probes with an address that is not supposed to audition
[07:50.000 --> 07:52.000]  if I'm not putting in the network.
[07:52.000 --> 07:54.000]  And you're trying to get vantage points in different networks.
[07:54.000 --> 07:56.000]  How many networks could you actually end up succeeding?
[07:57.000 --> 08:01.000]  And the number of vantage points that you could have with different networks
[08:01.000 --> 08:04.000]  basically means how many networks you can scan.
[08:04.000 --> 08:09.000]  And they scanned about 2,500 inputs, which is actually not bad.
[08:09.000 --> 08:11.000]  But there are a lot more.
[08:11.000 --> 08:15.000]  So in the last days on this, about the previous paper, it was almost like before.
[08:15.000 --> 08:16.000]  Yeah.
[08:16.000 --> 08:21.000]  This one is, the ability to spoofing is just trying to clarify that the paper that I'm going to discuss
[08:21.000 --> 08:25.000]  in this particular lecture is actually talking about the prevalence of spoofing and not being...
[08:25.000 --> 08:26.000]  Thank you.
[08:27.000 --> 08:33.000]  For the stuff that's easy because that stuff record basically is, you know,
[08:33.000 --> 08:36.000]  education institutions like us.
[08:36.000 --> 08:38.000]  Probably have one or two colliders.
[08:38.000 --> 08:39.000]  Typically one collider.
[08:39.000 --> 08:44.000]  It's very easy to check whether a traffic is being spooked or not because
[08:44.000 --> 08:47.000]  you pretty much know what your prefix is.
[08:47.000 --> 08:50.000]  So you can easily do a gris footprint.
[08:50.000 --> 08:54.000]  You have one prefix, but in the sense that these, you know, have one prefix.
[08:54.000 --> 08:56.000]  It's just fairly small.
[08:56.000 --> 09:00.000]  And it's very simple to ask, hey, you know, is this traffic in mind or not?
[09:00.000 --> 09:01.000]  Right?
[09:01.000 --> 09:02.000]  Then it goes out.
[09:02.000 --> 09:04.000]  Even that some networks don't move.
[09:04.000 --> 09:08.000]  I don't know if that means it's very easy for you to check.
[09:08.000 --> 09:10.000]  For the transit is really hard.
[09:10.000 --> 09:11.000]  Right?
[09:11.000 --> 09:13.000]  So you feel a transit.
[09:13.000 --> 09:18.000]  Figuring out exactly what traffic you get allowed to let through is really hard.
[09:18.000 --> 09:21.000]  It's not simply a question of asking your fear.
[09:21.000 --> 09:23.000]  What's the prefix you own?
[09:23.000 --> 09:26.000]  What's the prefix you have to come to that?
[09:26.000 --> 09:31.000]  And it makes it really hard because, you know, once again, your fear is tearing
[09:31.000 --> 09:33.000]  arrangements and other networks can also change.
[09:33.000 --> 09:36.000]  So it means you have to constantly keep updating.
[09:36.000 --> 09:42.000]  And there is no protocol or any band mechanism for this.
[09:42.000 --> 09:47.000]  The validity of your checks also depends on the position of the AS and the topology.
[09:47.000 --> 09:52.000]  What I mean by that is that a network, depending on where the falls under the AS hierarchy.
[09:53.000 --> 09:55.000]  So you do have, it's going to, it's flattening.
[09:55.000 --> 09:58.000]  You do have some, you know, sort of a hierarchy.
[09:58.000 --> 10:03.000]  There are networks like Dr. Tullikov, AT&T, I think.
[10:03.000 --> 10:05.000]  I'm not sure if you didn't want to remember.
[10:05.000 --> 10:08.000]  Anyway, there are a few networks that are called clear ones.
[10:08.000 --> 10:11.000]  There is no clear definition for a tier one.
[10:11.000 --> 10:14.000]  There are about 12 or 13 networks around the globe.
[10:14.000 --> 10:17.000]  They're called into the tier one networks.
[10:17.000 --> 10:19.000]  There's no formal strategy.
[10:19.000 --> 10:23.000]  But informal, you could think of these networks as networks that don't pay anyone.
[10:23.000 --> 10:29.000]  So, meaning if they send traffic to you, they don't pay you petals.
[10:29.000 --> 10:30.000]  Nothing.
[10:30.000 --> 10:38.000]  Then there are tier two networks, which typically to reach some prefixes, they'll get transit
[10:38.000 --> 10:39.000]  from clear ones.
[10:39.000 --> 10:46.000]  They're much larger than your, you know, regional ISPs, you know, for instance, let's say,
[10:46.000 --> 10:53.000]  you know, in the same way, you know, in the same way, you know, in the same way, you
[10:53.000 --> 10:54.000]  can't see it.
[10:54.000 --> 10:55.000]  So, you know, there are two.
[10:55.000 --> 10:56.000]  So, there are tier two.
[10:56.000 --> 10:57.000]  And then the last one is tier three.
[10:57.000 --> 11:02.000]  Tier three is basically what we refer to as the small networks that provide you internet
[11:02.000 --> 11:03.000]  connectivity.
[11:03.000 --> 11:06.000]  So, the ISPs at UNI have contracts.
[11:06.000 --> 11:10.000]  And depending on where you're following this hierarchy, it might be easier to talk
[11:10.000 --> 11:11.000]  into the fact.
[11:11.000 --> 11:14.000]  But it's going to be in a stubs are usually very low in hierarchy.
[11:14.000 --> 11:18.000]  You know, you pretty much depend on some of the areas you carry traffic or resume traffic
[11:18.000 --> 11:19.000]  from all time.
[11:19.000 --> 11:22.000]  And it's very easy for you to do this something.
[11:22.000 --> 11:27.000]  Whereas if you're a tier one, because you've been with so many other networks, it's really
[11:27.000 --> 11:33.000]  hard for you to figure out what traffic is allowed to pass through.
[11:33.000 --> 11:39.000]  Because if you see a faculty who tried to see is exposed to none, that requires you to
[11:40.000 --> 11:41.000]  do that.
[11:41.000 --> 11:46.000]  So, for any traffic coming through that interface, the areas in every everyone, you have to know
[11:46.000 --> 11:50.000]  every single valid prefix for every single network connected to that interface.
[11:50.000 --> 11:55.000]  That is not just your immediate peer, could be the peer of peers or their customers and
[11:55.000 --> 11:56.000]  so on.
[11:56.000 --> 11:57.000]  Okay.
